# Enhanced DAO System with Diamond Pattern Architecture

A comprehensive Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) implementation built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, following the diamond pattern for maximum modularity and upgradability.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The DAO system implements a modular diamond pattern architecture where different functionalities are separated into specialized contracts that work together seamlessly.

## üîê Security Model

### Access Control Hierarchy
```
Admin Role (Root)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Treasury Manager
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Proposer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Executor
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Voter (Default)
```

### Security Layers
1. **Smart Contract Level**: Clarity's built-in safety features
2. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions
3. **Timelock**: Mandatory delays for critical operations
4. **Multisig**: Multiple approval requirements
5. **Community Oversight**: Transparent governance process

## üìä Voting Strategies

### 1. Simple Majority (Default)

- Fastest execution path

### 2. Supermajority
- Requires 67% of participating votes
- Higher quorum requirements
- Enhanced security for critical changes

### 3. Quadratic Voting
- Voting power based on quadratic formula
- Reduces whale influence
- Promotes broader participation

### 4. Delegated Voting
- Representative democracy model
- Delegation chains supported
- Revocable delegations
